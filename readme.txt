Student Data Program

Description
This C++ program manages student data, allowing the user to input and display information for multiple students.

Features
-   Takes student name, roll number, total marks, and percentage as input.
-   Stores and displays student details for multiple students.
-   Utilizes a class to represent student objects.
-   Demonstrates the use of getters and setters to access and modify student information.

Code Structure
The code consists of three files:

-   `main.cpp` (c.txt): Contains the main function, which handles user input for multiple students and displays their details.
-   `student.cpp` (b.txt): Contains the implementation of the Student class methods (constructor, getters, and setters).
-   `header.h` (a.txt): Contains the declaration of the Student class.

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations.
-   string: For handling string data (student names).

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with a .cpp extension (e.g., main.cpp, student.cpp, header.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
